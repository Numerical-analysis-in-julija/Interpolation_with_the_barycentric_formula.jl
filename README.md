In this repository, you can finde the code for Homework 3 of the Numerical Methods course.The code is written in Julia, and the main implementation can be found in the file `src/Interpolation_with_the_barycentric_formula.jl`. The code is tested using the file `test/runtests.jl`, and it is documented using the file docs/make.jl, you can test the code for the specific by running the `Scripts/script.jl` file.

To run the code, it is necessary to have Julia installed on your computer. Once downloaded, you can run the code for the following equations:  e^{-x^2}  on \([-1,1]\) , sin(x)/x  on \([0,10]\) and |x^2-2x|  on \([1,3]\).To run the code, you can simply start the script  `Scripts/script.jl`.The script will compute the interpolation for the three equations and will return the reuslts to the precision of 1e-6.
